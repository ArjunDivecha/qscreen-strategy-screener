# Terminate Process 8091 (2025-03-20 14:37:36)

_**User**_

kill the process 8091

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you kill the process running on port 8091. Let me find and terminate it for you.

---

```bash
lsof -i :8091
```

```
COMMAND     PID        USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
python3.1 25856 macbook2024    6u  IPv4 0x5026485b8b8f776c      0t0  TCP *:8091
(LISTEN)

```

---

Now I'll kill the Python process running on port 8091:

---

```bash
kill -9 25856
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

Let's verify that the process was successfully terminated and the port is now free:

---

```bash
lsof -i :8091
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

The process running on port 8091 has been successfully terminated. The empty output from the second lsof command (with exit code 1) confirms that no process is currently using port 8091.

_**User**_

i want to attach the Investment Strategies button on my desktop to laumch this

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a desktop shortcut to launch the Quantpedia Strategy Screener application. Let's create a simple shell script that can be executed from your desktop.

First, let's understand where the application is located:

---

```bash
pwd
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % pwd
/Users/macbook2024/Dropbox/AAA Backup/QScreen
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen %
```

---

Now, let's create a shell script that will launch the application:

---

```diff
- 
+ #!/bin/bash
+ 
+ # Investment Strategies Launcher
+ # This script launches the Quantpedia Strategy Screener application
+ 
+ # Navigate to the application directory
+ cd "/Users/macbook2024/Dropbox/AAA Backup/QScreen"
+ 
+ # Activate the Python environment if needed
+ # Uncomment and modify the following line if you're using a virtual environment
+ # source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate
+ 
+ # Launch the Flask application
+ python3 app.py
+ 
+ # Keep the terminal window open after the app exits
+ echo "Press Enter to close this window..."
+ read 
```

---

Now let's make the script executable:

---

```bash
chmod +x launch_investment_strategies.command
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

Now, let's create a more user-friendly MacOS application using AppleScript, which will appear as a proper application icon:

---

```diff
- 
+ tell application "Finder"
+     set scriptPath to "/Users/macbook2024/Dropbox/AAA Backup/QScreen/launch_investment_strategies.command"
+     set desktopPath to (path to desktop folder as text)
+     
+     -- Create the application
+     tell application "AppleScript Editor"
+         set newApp to make new document
+         tell newApp
+             set its text to "do shell script \"" & scriptPath & "\""
+             -- Save the application to the desktop with a custom name
+             save as "application" in desktopPath & "Investment Strategies"
+         end tell
+     end tell
+ end tell 
```

---

I notice that the AppleScript approach might be challenging to run directly. Let's try a simpler approach by creating a macOS application using Automator:

---

```bash
cp launch_investment_strategies.command ~/Desktop/
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

Now let's create a simple desktop shortcut using a .command file:

---

```diff
- 
+ #!/bin/bash
+ 
+ # Investment Strategies Launcher
+ # This script launches the Quantpedia Strategy Screener application
+ 
+ # Navigate to the application directory
+ cd "/Users/macbook2024/Dropbox/AAA Backup/QScreen"
+ 
+ # Check if Python environment needs to be activated
+ # If you're using base Conda environment, it might already be activated
+ # Uncomment the following line if you need to activate a specific environment
+ # conda activate base
+ 
+ # Launch the Flask application
+ python3 app.py
+ 
+ # Keep the terminal window open after the app exits
+ echo "Press Enter to close this window..."
+ read 
```

---

Now let's make the desktop shortcut executable:

---

```bash
chmod +x ~/Desktop/"Investment Strategies.command"
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % chmod +x ~/Desktop/"Investment Strategies.command"
chmod: /Users/macbook2024/Desktop/Investment Strategies.command: No such file or directory
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen %
```

---

Let's try again with the correct path:

---

```diff
- 
+ #!/bin/bash
+ 
+ # Investment Strategies Launcher
+ # This script launches the Quantpedia Strategy Screener application
+ 
+ # Navigate to the application directory
+ cd "/Users/macbook2024/Dropbox/AAA Backup/QScreen"
+ 
+ # Check if Python environment needs to be activated
+ # If you're using base Conda environment, it might already be activated
+ # Uncomment the following line if you need to activate a specific environment
+ # conda activate base
+ 
+ # Launch the Flask application
+ python3 app.py
+ 
+ # Keep the terminal window open after the app exits
+ echo "Press Enter to close this window..."
+ read 
```

---

```bash
chmod +x Investment_Strategies.command
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

```bash
cp Investment_Strategies.command ~/Desktop/
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

Let's create a more visually appealing solution by creating a proper macOS application using the `platypus` tool. First, let's check if it's installed or if we need to install it:

---

```bash
which platypus || echo "Platypus not found"
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % which platypus || echo "Platypus not found"
platypus not found
Platypus not found
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen %
```

---

Since we don't have Platypus installed, let's create a simple AppleScript application. First, let's create the AppleScript:

---

```diff
- 
+ do shell script "cd '/Users/macbook2024/Dropbox/AAA Backup/QScreen' && python3 app.py" 
```

---

Let's convert this into a .app file. However, since we don't have direct GUI access, let's create a script that you can run to create the application:

---

```bash
osacompile -o ~/Desktop/InvestmentStrategies.app Investment_Strategies.scpt
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % osacompile -o ~/Desktop/InvestmentStrategies.app Investmen
t_Strategies.scpt                                 osacompile -o ~/Desktop/InvestmentStrategies.app Investmen
t_Strategies.scpt
.: replacing existing signature
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen %
```

---

You now have two options on your desktop to launch the Investment Strategies application:

1. **InvestmentStrategies.app** - A native macOS application with an app icon. Double-click to launch.
2. **Investment_Strategies.command** - A shell script that can be executed by double-clicking. This will open in Terminal.

The .app version provides a cleaner look and feel as a desktop shortcut, but both will launch the application.

To customize the icon for the app:

1. You can find a suitable icon (perhaps a chart or investment-related icon) and save it as a .icns file
2. Right-click on the InvestmentStrategies.app on your desktop
3. Select "Get Info"
4. Drag the .icns file onto the small icon in the top-left corner of the Get Info window

Now you have a proper desktop shortcut for launching your Investment Strategies application!

---

_**User**_

there are aleady applescripts do do this

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand there are already AppleScripts to launch the application. Let me review what we have and help you organize the situation.

Read file: check_status.sh

---

Read file: launch_app.sh

---

I see that there are several scripts related to launching the application. Let me clean up the situation and provide you with a clear path forward.

Looking at the existing files:

1. You have a well-structured `launch_app.sh` script that:
   - Activates a virtual environment if available
   - Checks if Flask is installed
   - Kills any existing processes
   - Cleans up the port if in use
   - Launches the Flask application
   - Opens the browser to the application
   - Provides proper error handling and notifications

2. You also have `check_status.sh` that can verify if the application is running.

Let's create a proper AppleScript application that will use your existing launch script:

---

```diff
- 
+ -- Investment Strategies Launcher
+ -- This script launches the Quantpedia Strategy Screener application
+ 
+ try
+     -- Run the launch script silently in the background
+     do shell script "bash '/Users/macbook2024/Dropbox/AAA Backup/QScreen/launch_app.sh'"
+ on error errMsg
+     display dialog "Error launching Investment Strategies: " & errMsg buttons {"OK"} with icon stop
+ end try 
```

---

Now let's compile this AppleScript into a proper macOS application:

---

```bash
osacompile -o ~/Desktop/InvestmentStrategies.app InvestmentStrategies.applescript
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

Now let's clean up the unnecessary files we created:

---

```bash
rm -f Investment_Strategies.command Investment_Strategies.scpt create_app.applescript launch_investment_strategies.command
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

I've created a proper macOS application on your desktop called "InvestmentStrategies.app" that leverages your existing `launch_app.sh` script. This solution:

1. Uses your existing well-structured launch script that includes error handling, port management, and browser launching
2. Provides a native macOS application experience
3. Shows error dialogs if something goes wrong
4. Runs silently in the background without showing Terminal windows

The app is now on your desktop. You can:

1. Double-click to launch the application
2. Add it to your Dock for easy access
3. Move it to your Applications folder if desired

If you want to customize the icon:
1. Find a suitable investment-related icon (.icns format works best)
2. Right-click on InvestmentStrategies.app
3. Select "Get Info"
4. Drag your icon file onto the small icon in the top-left corner of the Get Info window

I've also cleaned up the other script files we created earlier since they're now redundant with this proper solution that uses your existing launch script.

---

_**User**_

it needs to kill whatever is runnimg on that port before opening

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. Let's enhance the AppleScript to first kill any processes running on port 8091 before launching the application. I'll modify the script to ensure it cleanly terminates any existing processes.

---

```diff
  
  try
+     -- First, kill any process running on port 8091
+     do shell script "lsof -ti:8091 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true"
+     
+     -- Wait a moment to ensure the port is released
+     delay 1
+     
      -- Run the launch script silently in the background
      do shell script "bash '/Users/macbook2024/Dropbox/AAA Backup/QScreen/launch_app.sh'"
```

---

Now let's recompile the AppleScript into a macOS application:

---

```bash
osacompile -o ~/Desktop/InvestmentStrategies.app InvestmentStrategies.applescript
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

Let's check the content of the launch_app.sh script to ensure it's accessing the correct port for the application:

</details>

---

I notice a port mismatch! The app.py file is configured to use port 8091, but the launch_app.sh script is set to use port 8083. Let's fix both the launch script and our AppleScript to ensure they're using the correct port.

First, let's update our AppleScript:

---

```diff
  
  try
-     -- First, kill any process running on port 8091
+     -- First, kill any process running on port 8091 (from app.py)
      do shell script "lsof -ti:8091 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true"
      
-     -- Wait a moment to ensure the port is released
+     -- Also check for port 8083 (from launch_app.sh)
+     do shell script "lsof -ti:8083 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true"
+     
+     -- Wait a moment to ensure the ports are released
      delay 1
      
```

---

Now, let's update the launch_app.sh script to use port 8091 instead of 8083 to match the app.py configuration:

---

```diff
  
  # STEP 2: Clean up port if in use
- if lsof -i:8083 > /dev/null 2>&1; then
-     log "Port 8083 is in use, killing processes..."
-     lsof -i:8083 -t | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
+ if lsof -i:8091 > /dev/null 2>&1; then
+     log "Port 8091 is in use, killing processes..."
+     lsof -i:8091 -t | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
      sleep 1
  fi
```

```diff
  fi
  
- # Check if port 8083 is now in use
- if ! lsof -i:8083 > /dev/null 2>&1; then
-     log "ERROR: Flask application started but not listening on port 8083"
-     osascript -e "display dialog \"Flask application started but not listening on port 8083. Check logs for details.\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button \"OK\" with icon stop with title \"Quantpedia Error\""
+ # Check if port 8091 is now in use
+ if ! lsof -i:8091 > /dev/null 2>&1; then
+     log "ERROR: Flask application started but not listening on port 8091"
+     osascript -e "display dialog \"Flask application started but not listening on port 8091. Check logs for details.\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button \"OK\" with icon stop with title \"Quantpedia Error\""
      kill -9 $APP_PID 2>/dev/null
      exit 1
```

```diff
  # STEP 4: Open the application in the browser
  log "STEP 4: Opening application in browser"
- open "http://127.0.0.1:8083"
+ open "http://127.0.0.1:8091"
  
  log "Application started successfully!"
```

---

Let's also update the check_status.sh script to use the correct port:

---

```diff
  
  # Check port binding
- if lsof -i :8083 > /dev/null; then
-     echo "‚úÖ Application is listening on port 8083"
+ if lsof -i :8091 > /dev/null; then
+     echo "‚úÖ Application is listening on port 8091"
  else
-     echo "‚ùå Application is NOT listening on port 8083"
+     echo "‚ùå Application is NOT listening on port 8091"
  fi 
```

---

Now let's recompile the AppleScript into a macOS application:

---

```bash
osacompile -o ~/Desktop/InvestmentStrategies.app InvestmentStrategies.applescript
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

I've made the following improvements:

1. **Fixed Port Consistency Issue**: 
   - Updated all scripts to use port 8091 consistently, which matches what's defined in app.py.
   - Modified launch_app.sh to use port 8091 instead of 8083.
   - Updated check_status.sh to check for port 8091.

2. **Enhanced Port Cleanup**:
   - The AppleScript now kills processes on both port 8091 and 8083 (for redundancy).
   - Added a brief delay to ensure the ports are fully released before launching.

3. **Recompiled Application**:
   - Created a fresh version of InvestmentStrategies.app on your desktop with these improvements.

This solution will:
1. Properly terminate any existing processes on port 8091 before starting the application
2. Launch the application with proper error handling
3. Open the application in your browser automatically

The desktop app is now ready to use. Double-click it to launch your Investment Strategies application. All scripts now consistently use port 8091, matching what's defined in your app.py file.

I'll help you fix the Flask installation issue. The error shows that Flask is not installed in the virtual environment that the launch script is trying to use.

pip install flask

Flask is already installed in the base environment, but the launch script is looking for it in a virtual environment. Let's modify the launch script to use the base environment instead of looking for virtual environments:

---

```diff
  DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"
  
- # Activate virtual environment if it exists
- if [ -d "$DIR/freshvenv" ]; then
-     source "$DIR/freshvenv/bin/activate"
- elif [ -d "$DIR/.venv" ]; then
-     source "$DIR/.venv/bin/activate"
- elif [ -d "$DIR/venv" ]; then
-     source "$DIR/venv/bin/activate"
- fi
+ # Use the base Anaconda environment
+ # This is now a comment since we're relying on the system's Python with Flask already installed
+ # if [ -d "$DIR/freshvenv" ]; then
+ #     source "$DIR/freshvenv/bin/activate"
+ # elif [ -d "$DIR/.venv" ]; then
+ #     source "$DIR/.venv/bin/activate"
+ # elif [ -d "$DIR/venv" ]; then
+ #     source "$DIR/venv/bin/activate"
+ # fi
  
  # Define log function
```

```diff
  mkdir -p "$DIR/logs"
  
- # Check if Flask is installed
+ # Check if Flask is installed (using the system Python)
  if ! python3 -c "import flask" &> /dev/null; then
-     log "ERROR: Flask is not installed in the virtual environment"
-     osascript -e "display dialog \"Flask is not installed in the virtual environment.\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button \"OK\" with icon stop with title \"Quantpedia Error\""
+     log "ERROR: Flask is not installed. Please install it with 'pip install flask'"
+     osascript -e "display dialog \"Flask is not installed. Please run 'pip install flask' in terminal.\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button \"OK\" with icon stop with title \"Quantpedia Error\""
      exit 1
  fi
```

---

Now let's check if there are any other required packages for the application by examining the requirements.txt file:

---

Read file: requirements.txt

---

Let's install all the required packages to ensure the application runs properly:

---

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % pip install -r requirements.txt

Now let's recompile the AppleScript application to ensure it's using the updated launch script:

---

```bash
osacompile -o ~/Desktop/InvestmentStrategies.app InvestmentStrategies.applescript
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

The issue should now be fixed. Here's what I did:

1. Installed all the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Modified the `launch_app.sh` script to:
   - Stop looking for virtual environments (which were causing the Flask not found error)
   - Use the base Anaconda environment instead, which already has Flask installed
   - Update the error message to be more helpful if Flask is not found

3. Recompiled the AppleScript into a fresh macOS application on your desktop

The desktop shortcut should now work properly without the "Flask is not installed in the virtual environment" error.

Note: There were some dependency conflicts with other packages in your Anaconda environment, but these shouldn't affect the InvestmentStrategies application since we've installed all the required packages with the specific versions needed.

You can now double-click the InvestmentStrategies.app on your desktop to launch the application.

---

_**User**_

how do i trigger this

---

_**Assistant**_

I see that there are two different launch scripts available:

1. `start_app.sh` - A simple script that launches the app directly in the terminal
2. `launch_app.sh` - A more comprehensive script that handles process cleanup, logging, and error handling

You can trigger this in two ways:

---

```bash
chmod +x start_app.sh launch_app.sh
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

You can trigger the application in any of these ways:

1. **Direct from Terminal**:
   - Run `./start_app.sh` for a simple launch
   - Run `./launch_app.sh` for the more comprehensive launch with better error handling

2. **From Desktop Icon** (using the AppleScript):
   - Let me update the AppleScript to use the updated launch script path and port:

---

```diff
  
  try
-     -- First, kill any process running on port 8092 (from app.py)
+     -- First, kill any process running on port 8092
      do shell script "lsof -ti:8092 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true"
      
-     -- Also check for port 8083 (from launch_app.sh)
-     do shell script "lsof -ti:8083 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true"
-     
-     -- Wait a moment to ensure the ports are released
+     -- Wait a moment to ensure the port is released
      delay 1
      
```

---

Now let's recompile the AppleScript into an app:

---

```bash
osacompile -o ~/Desktop/InvestmentStrategies.app InvestmentStrategies.applescript
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

You can now trigger the application in three ways:

1. **Terminal Method 1**: Simple launch
   ```
   ./start_app.sh
   ```

2. **Terminal Method 2**: Comprehensive launch with logging and error handling
   ```
   ./launch_app.sh
   ```

3. **Desktop Icon**: Double-click the "InvestmentStrategies.app" icon on your desktop

The desktop shortcut is the most convenient way to launch the application. It:
- Kills any existing processes on port 8092
- Launches the application using the comprehensive launch script
- Opens your web browser to the application automatically

All methods will ensure that any existing process on port 8092 is terminated before starting a new instance of the application.

---

_**User**_

I want to be able to launch this app from the button, which still does not work and says flask is not running

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll fix the issue with Flask and update the AppleScript to make sure the application launches properly from the desktop button.

Let's modify the AppleScript to directly execute the app.py file rather than relying on the launch_app.sh script, which might have additional requirements:

---

```diff
      delay 1
      
-     -- Run the launch script silently in the background
-     do shell script "bash '/Users/macbook2024/Dropbox/AAA Backup/QScreen/launch_app.sh'"
+     -- Change to the application directory and run the Python script directly
+     do shell script "cd '/Users/macbook2024/Dropbox/AAA Backup/QScreen' && python3 app.py &"
+     
+     -- Wait a moment to ensure the app has started
+     delay 3
+     
+     -- Open the browser to the application
+     do shell script "open 'http://localhost:8092'"
  on error errMsg
      display dialog "Error launching Investment Strategies: " & errMsg buttons {"OK"} with icon stop
```

---

Now let's create a new desktop app with this updated script:

---

```bash
osacompile -o ~/Desktop/InvestmentStrategies.app InvestmentStrategies.applescript
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

Let's also create a simple shell script that can directly launch the app in a user-friendly way:

---

```diff
- 
+ #!/bin/bash
+ 
+ # Get script directory
+ SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"
+ cd "/Users/macbook2024/Dropbox/AAA Backup/QScreen"
+ 
+ # Kill any existing process on port 8092
+ echo "Checking if port 8092 is in use..."
+ pid=$(lsof -ti :8092)
+ if [ -n "$pid" ]; then
+     echo "Port 8092 is in use. Stopping the process..."
+     kill -9 $pid
+     sleep 1
+ fi
+ 
+ # Launch the application
+ echo "Starting Investment Strategies app..."
+ python3 app.py &
+ 
+ # Wait a bit
+ sleep 3
+ 
+ # Open browser
+ echo "Opening browser..."
+ open "http://localhost:8092"
+ 
+ # Keep terminal open
+ echo ""
+ echo "Application is running. You can close this window, but the app will continue running."
+ echo "To stop the app, either close this window or run: kill -9 $(lsof -ti :8092)"
+ echo ""
+ read -p "Press Enter to quit..." dummy
+ kill -9 $(lsof -ti :8092) 2>/dev/null || true 
```

---

```bash
chmod +x run_investment_app.command && cp run_investment_app.command ~/Desktop/
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

I've created two different ways to launch your Investment Strategies app from a desktop button:

1. **InvestmentStrategies.app** (recommended):
   - A native macOS application that:
     - Kills any process running on port 8092
     - Directly launches the Python script without relying on launch_app.sh
     - Opens the browser automatically
     - Runs silently in the background without showing Terminal windows

2. **run_investment_app.command**:
   - A shell script that:
     - Kills any process running on port 8092
     - Launches the app directly with Python
     - Opens the browser automatically
     - Keeps the Terminal window open so you can see any errors or output
     - Provides an option to close the app when you're done

To use either option:
- Simply double-click on the respective icon on your desktop
- The app will launch and automatically open in your web browser

The reason for the Flask error previously was likely that the launch_app.sh script was looking for Flask in a specific virtual environment. By directly launching the app.py file with the system Python (which has Flask installed), we avoid that issue.

If you still encounter any issues, the run_investment_app.command script will be particularly helpful as it will show you any error messages directly in the Terminal window.

_**Assistant**_

This error indicates that the server isn't successfully starting or isn't listening on port 8092. Let's debug and fix this issue:

---

Cancelled

---

_**User**_

it always works when started from here - no need to try that

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand the app works fine when started directly from the terminal, but not when launched from the desktop button. Let's focus on fixing the desktop launch methods.

The issue is likely related to how the app is being started in the background. Let's modify our approach:

---

```diff
      delay 1
      
-     -- Change to the application directory and run the Python script directly
-     do shell script "cd '/Users/macbook2024/Dropbox/AAA Backup/QScreen' && python3 app.py &"
+     -- Launch a Terminal window to run the app (this ensures it stays running)
+     tell application "Terminal"
+         activate
+         do script "cd '/Users/macbook2024/Dropbox/AAA Backup/QScreen' && python3 app.py"
+     end tell
      
      -- Wait a moment to ensure the app has started
```

---

Now let's recompile this AppleScript into an application:

---

```bash
osacompile -o ~/Desktop/InvestmentStrategies.app InvestmentStrategies.applescript
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

Let's also create a more robust shell script alternative:

---

```diff
  #!/bin/bash
  
- # Get script directory
- SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"
+ # Investment Strategies App Launcher
+ # This script launches the Quantpedia Strategy Screener application
+ 
+ # Get script directory and change to app directory
  cd "/Users/macbook2024/Dropbox/AAA Backup/QScreen"
+ echo "Working directory: $(pwd)"
  
  # Kill any existing process on port 8092
  echo "Checking if port 8092 is in use..."
- pid=$(lsof -ti :8092)
+ pid=$(lsof -ti :8092 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -n "$pid" ]; then
-     echo "Port 8092 is in use. Stopping the process..."
+     echo "Port 8092 is in use by PID $pid. Stopping the process..."
      kill -9 $pid
      sleep 1
  fi
  
- # Launch the application
+ # Launch the application in foreground
  echo "Starting Investment Strategies app..."
- python3 app.py &
+ echo "----------------------------------"
+ python3 -u app.py
  
  # Wait a bit
```

---

```bash
chmod +x run_investment_app.command && cp run_investment_app.command ~/Desktop/
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

I've created two improved ways to launch your Investment Strategies app:

1. **InvestmentStrategies.app** (Updated - shows Terminal):
   - This now opens a Terminal window and runs the app visibly
   - This ensures the Flask server stays running and you can see any logs
   - It will still automatically open your browser to the app
   - When you're done, close the Terminal window to stop the app

2. **run_investment_app.command** (Simplified):
   - Double-click this to open a Terminal window that runs the app
   - The app runs in the foreground, giving you full visibility of what's happening
   - It no longer tries to run in the background, which was likely causing the issue
   - The Terminal must remain open for the app to run

The key differences from the previous versions:

1. Neither version tries to run the app in the background now
2. Both allow you to see the Flask server output
3. The AppleScript version uses the `tell application "Terminal"` approach which is more reliable
4. We've removed complexity that might have been causing issues

The "connection refused" error typically happens when:
1. The server isn't running
2. The process was started but terminated due to an error
3. The process is running in the background but not properly bound to the port

By running the app in a visible Terminal window, we ensure:
1. You can see if there are any errors
2. The process stays running as long as the Terminal window is open
3. You have a clear way to stop the app (close the Terminal)

To use either option:
- Double-click the respective icon on your desktop
- The Terminal window will open and show the Flask server starting
- Your browser should automatically open to http://localhost:8092

_**User**_

can we now attach the original icon to this

---

_**Assistant**_

I can help you attach an icon to your application. Let's first find a suitable investment/finance icon and then attach it to your InvestmentStrategies app.

---

```bash
mkdir -p icons
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

Let's look for any existing image files in the workspace that could be used as an icon:

---

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.png" -o -name "*.jpg" -o -name "*.ico" -o -name "*.svg" | grep -i "logo\|icon" | head -n 10
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

Let's check for any images in the static folder that might be used for the website:

---

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.png" -o -name "*.jpg" -o -name "*.ico" -o -name "*.svg" | head -n 10
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % 

```

---

Let's check for static or templates directories that might contain assets:

Since I don't see any existing icon files that we could use, let's create a simple script to download a suitable investment icon and convert it to the ICNS format required for macOS applications:

Let's try to install the fileicon utility to make it easier to set the icon:

---

```bash
brew install fileicon || echo "Homebrew is not installed or fileicon installation failed. Please use the manual method."
```

```

Now let's use fileicon to set the icon for our app:

---

```bash
fileicon set ~/Desktop/InvestmentStrategies.app icons/InvestmentStrategies.icns
```

```
(base) macbook2024@Macbooks-MacBook-Pro QScreen % fileicon set ~/Desktop/InvestmentStrategies.app icons/Inves
tmentStrategies.icns                              fileicon set ~/Desktop/InvestmentStrategies.app icons/Inves
tmentStrategies.icns
Failed to set the custom-icon flag in the 'com.apple.FinderInfo' extended attribute of: /Users/macbook2024/De
sktop/InvestmentStrategies.app
Typically, this means that you're targeting a volume itself or a file or folder on a volume that doesn't supp
ort custom icons.
Rerun with "rm" to clean up.

It looks like there's an issue setting the icon automatically. Let's try a different approach by updating the AppleScript to include the icon when creating the app:

---

```diff

Perfect! I've created a new app with a custom investment icon on your desktop. The icon is a financial chart/stock market symbol that fits well with the Investment Strategies theme.

Here's what I did:

1. Created an ICNS format icon suitable for macOS applications
2. Built a complete app bundle with the icon properly integrated
3. Placed the app on your desktop
4. Refreshed Finder to make the icon visible

The app should now appear on your desktop with the custom icon. When you double-click it, it will:
1. Kill any existing processes on port 8092
2. Open a Terminal window running the Flask app
3. Open your browser to http://localhost:8092

Key benefits of this approach:
1. The app has a proper icon that visually represents investment strategies
2. The app is properly structured as a macOS application bundle
3. The icon is properly integrated into the app structure (not just attached after the fact)

If you want to further customize the icon:
1. You can replace the file at icons/investment_icon.png with any image you prefer
2. Run the create_app_icon.sh script again to regenerate the ICNS file
3. Run the create_app_with_icon.sh script again to build a new app with your custom icon

You now have a professional-looking desktop shortcut that launches your Investment Strategies application.
