  This Flask application provides a web interface for browsing, filtering, and analyzing
  investment strategies from Quantpedia. It features AI-powered summarization using
- Groq's LLM models (llama-3.3-70b-specdec and qwen-qwq-32b), caching mechanisms for improved performance,
+ Groq's LLM models (llama3-70b-8192 and compound-beta), caching mechanisms for improved performance,
  and comprehensive filtering options.
  
```

---

I've updated the docstring to correctly reference the models currently being used in the application:
- Changed "llama-3.3-70b-specdec" to "llama3-70b-8192" 
- Changed "qwen-qwq-32b" to "compound-beta"

This now accurately matches the models that are being used in your code for the API calls to Groq.
